## Project Overview

This project integrates a batch workflow system into Neurodesktop by combining Elyra and Kubeflow Pipelines. It allows Neurodesktop users to develop Jupyter notebooks in Neurodesktop and submit them as batch jobs for execution on Kubeflow Pipelines, a Kubernetes-based system.

Kubeflow Pipelines is a platform for building, deploying, and running machine learning (ML) workflows. It uses Docker containers to run components of a pipeline and enables efficient execution of tasks, both in series and parallel, by organising them into a computational directed acyclic graph (DAG). Kubeflow Pipelines also offers features like tracking pipeline runs, managing ML artifacts, and optimising resource usage. Pipelines are authored in Python using the KFP SDK, compiled into YAML, and submitted to a KFP backend, which can run on local Kubernetes clusters like Minikube or on cloud services. In this project, we will run Kubeflow Pipelines on a Minikube Kubernetes cluster, and <u>**the pipelines will be authored using Elyra**</u>.

In this setup, Elyra is used to create and manage pipelines. Its Pipeline Visual Editor in JupyterLab simplifies the process of converting multiple notebooks into batch jobs. Since Elyra is already included in the Neurodesktop Dockerfile, building these pipelines directly from the notebooks is straightforward and efficient.

The Neurodesktop container runs on the same machine as the Minikube cluster that hosts Kubeflow Pipelines. To ensure that Neurodesktopâ€™s neuroimaging tools are available within the pipelines, CVMFS-CSI is used to expose the necessary modules and tools. A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is created within the cluster, allowing these resources to be accessed by the runtime image executing the Jupyter notebooks.

## Prerequistes
- Minikube: Used to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines on a local Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker: Required for running Neurodesktop.

## Setup Guide

### Neurodesktop Setup

1. **Clone the OjaswinKohli/neurodesktop repository** \
    Clone the Neurodesktop repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OjaswinKohli/neurodesktop.git
    ```
    After cloning, navigate to the repository:
    ```bash
    cd neurodesktop
    ```

2. **Build and Run Neurodesktop using Docker** \
   If you are using Linux, run the following script to build and run Neurodesktop:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./build_and_run_on_linux.sh 
    ./build_and_run_on_linux.sh 
    ```

   If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), run this script instead:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./build_and_run.sh 
    ./build_and_run.sh 
    ```

3. **Access Neurodesktop** \
  After the script finishes, Neurodesktop will be accessible on port 8888. Open the link printed in the terminal using a web browser.
